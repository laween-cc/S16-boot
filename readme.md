# S16 - boot
This is a boot sector for S16

I got **some** inspiration from MS/PC-DOS & CP/M, but I decided to throw out all of the janky parts.

You can find my implementation of [the boot sector here!](boot.asm)

You can also find [the SYSTEM / KERNEL here.](https://github.com/mekebabman/S16)

## Specifation
S16's boot sector has a specifation in case someone wants to create a disk tool or wants to improve upon my boot sector implementation.
